                <h2>Pitzi's Life:</h2>
                <p>Pitzi's date of birth is unknown. That is because she was brought to me already grown up (I think she
                    was one or two years old at that time), at Christmas Time in December 2008, with the request to take
                    care of her for one month period.</p>
                <p> That was because she was kept in an office and all the people were about to leave for a few weeks
                    for the winter vacation. Thus, Pitzi the Cat had no place to live in for that period of time and if
                    she would have been let outside on her own, there were dogs that usually killed cats. Also, Pitzi
                    the cat didn't know how to live in the streets, search for food and fend herself like a stray cat.
                    So I accepted to take care of her for one month and the rest is history.</p>
                <p>She proved to be <strong>Incredibly Loyal and Protective</strong>. Once, she thought my life was in
                    danger (due to a silly joke of a woman that was a close friend) and even if Pitzi was way smaller
                    than the "attacker" she fiercely intervened between us and stand up to defend me and save my life -
                    she was so sweet and courageous and clearly communicated her feelings and intentions and we saw that
                    she had no hesitation to put her life on the line for mine).</p>
                <p>She was also <strong>Loving</strong> and <strong> Full of Affection</strong> and was always alert in
                    order to protect the house and quick to Welcome me when returning home, showing how much she missed
                    me. There was no need to ever tell her to do or not to do something, cos she always felt what I
                    want and did that accordingly.</p>
                <p> Pitzi was <strong>Incredibly Smart</strong>. I know that people who haven't known her would smile
                    and think this is an exaggeration, but Pitzi was <u>able to invent by her own a complex Language in
                        order to communicate with me</u>... that is an Incredible thing for a cat. She was also
                    <strong>Very Curious</strong> about how the toilet and faucets work, she figured out on her own how
                    to open a closed door by jumping on the door handle or press it with her front paws and did a lot of
                    other amazing things.
                </p>
                <p>She also possessed a <strong>Very Kind Heart</strong> which is a strange thing when talking about a
                    top predator such as a cat. But that's the Truth, as she once found out a little sparrow who had not
                    known yet how to fly and was hiding itself in a small hole in my yard. Pitzi stayed by the little
                    bird guarding it for 10 to 15 minutes at least, until I understood that she found something and
                    won't leave it till she would gain my attention in order to come and solve the problem - which I
                    did... I took the little sparrow and went with it to the vet, who told me they will keep it and feed
                    it
                    till it will be able to fly, cos it is very little and I will not be able to take care of it on
                    my own.</p>
                <p>Pitzi proved again and again to be a <strong>True Friend</strong>! On 30 October 2018 I was about to
                    die in a motorcycle accident in which I was thrown with 50km/h head first into a fixed object
                    because
                    of a car driver who carelessly changed lanes, hit me and run away even if some witnesses tried to
                    stop him. I suffered multiple traumas, including multiple vertebral column fractures, many herniated
                    discs, marrow and nerves compressions, a broken rib, etc. After accident I was in tremendous pain
                    and Pitzi felt it. She used to come and lay on the affected areas and suffered along with me...</p>
                <p>Everybody loved Pitzi. Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever! In the morning of 27 October 2019,
                    at
                    one year after my motorcycle accident and when I suppose she was at least 12 years old,
                    Pitzi died
                    of unclear reasons without being able to breath in the final phase. A few days before that, she
                    stopped eating so I took her to the vets but they were unable to tell the cause, nor to do something
                    to help her. I tried to feed her with special liquid food, help her how I could and I stayed with
                    her till her last moments without being able to save her. I also didn't think she would die till her
                    last hours, as the vets haven't told me she was in such danger. She died like a warrior, without
                    showing any signs of weakness: no crying, no nothing, she just looked sad but grateful that I am
                    with
                    her - though I could
                    feel all the pain she went through... R.I.P. Pitzi, you've had a heart worthy of a great warrior!

                    <h2>Pitzi's Ancestry:</h2>
                    <p>When Pitzi was still alive and with me, I knew about her ancestry as much as I knew about her
                        date of
                        birth: basically nothing! However, I was always amazed how much she resembles a Siberian Forest
                        Cat
                        of original color, which is tabby. That was more amazing taking into consideration that this
                        breed
                        had some very specific characteristics regarding the head, eyes, ears, fur, paws and tail, which
                        are
                        not common to the other cats and that they <strong>Love Water</strong> and <strong>Act More
                            Like A
                            Dog</strong> than a cat - which Pitzi did! It was only about 2 years after the Pitzi died,
                        that
                        I've
                        found out that she was brought to that office by a lady who had such long hair cats at home. To
                        better understand how Pitzi the Cat was like and to learn more about such a beautiful cat breed
                        like
