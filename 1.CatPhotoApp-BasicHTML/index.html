                <!--! Attribute "action" indicates to the browser where Form data should be sent -->

                <fieldset>
                    <!--! <fieldset></fieldset> is a block-level element used to group related inputs and labels together in a Web Form. -->

                    <legend>Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat?</legend>
                    <!--! <legend></legend> element acts as a Caption for the content in the <fieldset> element, giving the user a context about what to enter into that part of the Form. -->

                    <label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor" checked />
                        Indoor</label>

                    <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor" /> Outdoor</label>


                    <!--! Radio buttons are used for questions where you want ONLY ONE answer out of multiple options. -->

                    <!--! Attribute "id" is used to identify specific HTML elements, thus and "id" must be Unique throughout the entire Page. -->

                    <!-- ! <input name="..." /> does not have to be unique, and can be used to group elements together such as radio buttons & checkboxes. Attribute "name" shares the same namespace as the "id" Atrribute and is used by Form elements to submit information, as ONLY "input" elements with a "name" Attribute are submitted to the server. -->

                    <!-- ! If you select a radio button and submit the Form, the Form data for the radio button is based on its "name" and "value" Attributes. If "value" Attribute is missing, the Form data will include "indoor-outdoor=on" - which is not useful when you have multiple buttons.-->

                </fieldset>

                <fieldset>

                    <legend>What's your cat's personality?</legend>

                    <!--! <label></label> element is an INLINE element.-->

                    <!--! <label></label> associates a TEXT label to an <input /> element, thus clicking the <input /> element or its TEXT label act the same (for instance both actions can check a radio button or a checkbox). -->

                    <!--! <label> element can envelope the <input /> element or refer to it by using the Attribute "for='input-element_id'". In the latter case, the <label> element can be placed Before or After the <input /> element. -->

                    <!--! Just like in the case of radio buttons, the Form data submitted for a selected checkbox is based on its "name" and "value" Attributes. While the "value" Attribute is Optional, it is Best Practice to include it with any checkbox or radio button on the Page. -->

                    <!--! In order to make a radio button or checkbox Checked by default, add the "checked" Attribute to that <input> element. -->

                </fieldset>

                <input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required />
                <!--! <input /> element is an INLINE element.-->


                <!--! <input placeholder="..." /> is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an <input> element.-->

                <!--! <input required /> prevent the user from submitting the Form when a required information is missing. -->

                <button type="submit">Submit</button>
                <!--! <button></button> element is an INLINE element.-->

                <!--! <button></button> creates a clickable button. Without any Attribute specified, the default behavior of a button is to submit the Form to the location specified in the Form's "action" Attribute. Best practice is to specify "type='submit'" though. -->
